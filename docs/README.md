## History

One day I've decided to move all my personal notes to markdown files. Fast search showed, that there is no well featured software on Android to work with markdown, so I'm started this project.

Because I'm intersting in cross-platform development, this application works both in Android and Windows 10 (UWP application).

## Future plans

1. Localizations
2. Using hot keys

## What's inside

mdNote based on SimpleMDE Markdown Editor and builded using Xamarin.Forms.

Android version using FontAwesome for icons.
