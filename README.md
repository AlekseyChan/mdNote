# mdNote

## What is that

This software WYSIWYG markdown editor for Android(KitKat+) and Windows 10. 

## History

One day I've decided to move all my personal notes to markdown files. Fast search showed, that there is no well featured software on Android to work with markdown, so I'm started this project.

Because I'm intersting in cross-platform development, this application works both in Android and Windows 10 (UWP application).

## Privacy policy
